<h1>October 15, 2024</h1>
<li>twenty three</li>
<br>
<h1>July 10, 2024</h1>
<li>changed a header but im still pissed the fonts kinda fucked even after a kerning adjust. i can DEAL with certain desktop resolutions having it overlay my replika but i Cannot stand for cannibal being unreadable. thats a crime. they hate girls like me</li>
<br>
<h1>July 8, 2024</h1>
<li>the lennster licked my sack lovingly. new Bloodesss</li>
<br>
<h1>July 1, 2024</h1>
<li>Bloodess update<br>DID actually "add" a page because it was necessarily and Totally Not Because If MY Autoplaying MIDIs Want To Play Pages Have To Be Accessed Directly So I'm Using A Big Fuck Off Warning Button On Index So People Can Hear More MIDIs but im also super lazy so it looks bad. whatever.<br>the goal is to just sound insane before you havent seen shit</li>
<br>
<h1>March 17, 2024</h1>
<li>SIGNALIS update (also i Should update the site for 2024. whenever work decides to give me a day off to do so so i.e. in 10 months i might have a full weekend)</li>
<br>
<h1>October 19, 2023</h1>
<li>got older again</li>
<br>
<h1>August 24, 2023</h1>
<li>jesus fuck i havent updated in a while sorry. also exes birthday update (i still miss her. i still miss her)<br>updated a bit of the contact page because billionaires do stupid things, and reworded a couple phrases on the home and about pages to make me sound a lot more sad and defeated (but not suicidal thats too scary)</li>

<br>
<h1>July 4, 2022</h1>
<li>so the hosters for freegb died a couple months ago (as in like they stopped paying their servers, domain expired, now their fckin security certificate expired so theyre REALLY dead now) and its been so heartbreaking for me since that was one of the only remaining things from my original site. regardless ive put up a <a href="http://users3.smartgb.com/g/g.php?a=s&amp;i=g36-33579-cb">new guestbook</a> to sign</li>
